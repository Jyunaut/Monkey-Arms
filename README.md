# Monkey-Arms
A 48-Hour Practice Jam (September 2021)

Theme:
Vulnerable by design

Description:
Vertical top-down climber, where the player has 2 stretchy limbs that they use to climb. Outstretched limbs are a lingering hitbox that can be targeted by enemies.
Intentional finicky control scheme to stunt the playerâ€™s confidence, better encompassing the theme.

Visual Theme:
Monkey + Jungle
